Argus
=====

This repository is deprecated -- but the code lives on!

Argus is a javascript library for displaying large hierarchies. It was designed
to work with the Open Tree of Life's treemachine and taxomachine.  

Cody Hinchliff wrote most of argus.

The code is still being used and maintained by the Open Tree of Life. In order
to simplify the installation and deployment of the software, the code that 
was in this repository has moved to a the opentree repo at:
 https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/opentree

Please check out the webapp/static/js/argus directory of that repo for the 
most recent versions of argus.
